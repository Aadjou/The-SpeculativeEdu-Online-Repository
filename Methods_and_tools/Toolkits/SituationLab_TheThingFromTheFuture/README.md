Want to play The Thing From The Future but don’t have your deck of game cards? Hanging out on the space station or at Amundsen-Scott and eager to imagine some future things with your fellow astronauts / scientists / adventurers, but frustrated by the slow pace or total absence of postal delivery service? Just plain broke? Look no further — you can now download and print your own complete version of The Thing From the Future.

The Print-and-Play edition of The Thing From The Future contains everything you need to start playing with alternative futures — including printable cards, instructions, playsheets, and blank cards that you can customize with your own content. Simply download and print the .pdf, cut the cards (or, in a pinch, we suppose you could tear them), and start playing.
