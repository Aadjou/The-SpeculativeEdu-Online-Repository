[Futures Wheel on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_wheel)

The Future wheel is a method for graphical visualisation of direct and indirect future consequences of a particular change or development. It was invented by Jerome C. Glenn in 1971, when he was a student at the Antioch Graduate School of Education (now Antioch University New England).

    The Futures Wheel is a way of organizing thinking and questioning about the future â€“ a kind of structured brainstorming. (Jerome C. Glenn (1994) The Futures Wheel)
