[The Tarot Cards of Tech](https://www.artefactgroup.com/case-studies/the-tarot-cards-of-tech/)

As designers, we want to design products people love. We also want to create technology that leaves a positive mark on the world, and that takes more than just asking if a product is engaging and enjoyable. We also must ask: Are we designing products that support the world we all want to live in, today and tomorrow?

Artefact is proud to introduce The Tarot Cards of Tech: a tool to inspire important conversations around the true impact of technology and the products we design. The Tarot Cards of Tech encourage creators to think about the outcomes technology can create, from unintended consequences to opportunities for positive change. The cards are our way of helping you gaze into the future to determine how to make your product the best it can be.
