in education:

method/approach? approach

method:
share stories
cook and digest fantastic things, experiment
play with reality and fool in and around it, camping … But seriously
provoke reflective activities in public contexts as well as meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations
build the bridge between our distinct disciplinary micro-worlds and nomenclatures (example: smart city)
combine the elements of provocation and practicality; criticality and participation; aesthetic spectacularity and social involvement
