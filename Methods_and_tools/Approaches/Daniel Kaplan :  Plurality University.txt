method/approach? approach

method:
call upon the senses, all senses, and communicate/engage beyond language
expose everyone to stories, images, metaphors ... emerging from wholly different cultures and practices
consider that everyone should be futurists (not professional futurists, “citizen-futurists”, capable of projecting themselves and their communities towards diverse futures and reflecting on their desirability, on how to get there, on what it tells us about the present, on how to work with uncertainty and controversy, etc.)
work proactively with people who, today, do not feel entitled or capable of talking about the future
broaden the set of “thinkable futures”
