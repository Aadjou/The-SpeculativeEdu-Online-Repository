method/approach? approach

method:
think about what’s preferable
you can use any dystopian, utopian or other particular lens in a project as a vehicle
craft the speculation from the bottom up with localised interventions from which can emerge a bigger picture
familiarise yourself with the unknown by allowing the creation of positive protentions
get the attention of the audience or passerby
establish a second layer: start to engage some more ideas, and layers of content (and hopefully value) so the more someone engages with a project the more they “should” get out of it
