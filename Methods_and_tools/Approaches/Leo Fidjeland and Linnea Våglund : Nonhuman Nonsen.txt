Leo Fidjeland and Linnea VÃ¥glund / Nonhuman Nonsense

domains:
Art and Design, science and technology

in education:

method/approach? approach

method:
open the public imaginary of how the world could be different, but not necessarily how it should be
tell stories that lie somewhere between utopia and dystopia
allow complex entanglements of the world to remain complex
use contradictions and paradoxes
enable more people (not just experts and policymakers or wealthy philanthropists), to take part in the discourses of what societies we want
instill a sense of opening and curiosity that allows people to explore and consider their position from different perspectives without having to identify strongly or attach themselves to views and opinions
Are multi-layered and allow for complexity, but at the same time accessible and simple (but not simplistic).
Are based (appropriately) base on science, but also on critical theory, philosophy and anthropology
