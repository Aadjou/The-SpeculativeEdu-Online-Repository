method/approach? approach

method:
construct interactive situations not unlike the normal physical world
encourage playful experience-driven exploration of the space and its behaviours, alone and in groups
develop details of the storyworld, characters and institutions, imaginations of narratives and motivations, then objects and façades for the creation of an experiential future
Surprise: If a project and some results lead to something that you expected, then you probably haven’t dived in deep enough
Everyday: break down speculations about possible futures to the effects that will be found in everyday life
Experience: creating an experience of a scenario is more valuable that a description
