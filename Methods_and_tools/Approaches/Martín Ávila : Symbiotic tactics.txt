Martín Ávila / Symbiotic tactics

domains:
Transdisciplinary, with Design-driven agenda

in education:
BA. In this sense, MA and PhD students


method/approach? approach

method:
design-driven and addresses forms of interspecies cohabitation
a more “scientific” and “positivistic” agenda at IMBIV,
a more political agenda at ACC, 
a research-through practice agenda at Konstfack. 
All the projects that I did have an overlap of these three agendas
confront humans with alternative possibilities of relating to ecosystems in all their diversity
material cultures produce a diversity of responses capable of tuning to biological and ecological diversity.
