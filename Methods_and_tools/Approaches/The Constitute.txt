method/approach? approach

method:
To move from apologetic prototyping (the idea defending itself in the real world) to diegetic prototyping (telling, explaining, narrating an idea through multi-sensual language)
detecting now tendencies
Analyze: predict future implications
Fantasize: rendering plausible scenarios
Concretize: developing significant object
Realize: making it a physical experience

Accessibility and traceability of the idea and its physical presence. Can I use it, feel it and by this understand it better to follow the intended idea?

Does it take all cultural, possible biographical and political aspects into account surrounding the intended idea? Can I relate intellectually to the projectâ€™s formulated conclusion?

is it easy to communicate beyond its physical presence in e.g. social media and websites? Can everybody see it?
