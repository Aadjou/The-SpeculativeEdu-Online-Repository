# Methods and Tools
This folder contains documentation and materials about the various approaches, methods and tools for Speculative Design.
We have identified them, through the analysis of the state of the art of Speculative Design in the book of the Speculative Edu project, and through the interviews which we have conducted during the first part of the project.
