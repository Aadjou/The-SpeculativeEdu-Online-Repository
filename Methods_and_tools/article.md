# Approaches, Methods and Tools for Speculative Design

In the SpeculativeEdu project, we have tried to gather a wider understanding about how designers and other practitioners use Speculative Design techniques in order to compose future scenarios. On top of that, we have reflected on how these techniques can be introduced in education processes and paths to trigger ethical, critical, innovative designs which are able to bring together different publics in participatory ways.
To do this, we have used a series of different sources of information.
First of all, we used the interviews to speculative design practitioners that were performed during the project, in which we investigated how different subjects and organizations approach speculative design and related practices, how they integrate them in their work, what scenarios they envision for speculative design, and how they imagine it being integrated in education practices.
On top of that, we performed an extensive research about the tools, materials, models and process architectures that different practitioners use in their practice, as well as in workshop, courses, corporate sessions, and more.
From both types of inspection, it appears clear how most subjects in the domain intend speculative design as an approach, more than a formal methology, with the intent of bringing together multiple disciplines, skills, competences, cultures and interests.
As part of the SpeculativeEdu project we are creating an online repository of materials, documentation, tools and references so that a series of resources can be made easily accessible to perform speculative design processes, and to be able to have these resources from coming multiple origins readily available for analysis, to better understand the wider picture of speculative design as it is intended from multiple parties and organizations.
The online repository is [HERE](https://github.com/speculativeedu/The-SpeculativeEdu-Online-Repository), and it will be mentioned multiple times in this article, to have some practical examples available.
