# Approaches, Methods and Tools for Speculative Design

In the SpeculativeEdu project, we have tried to gather a wider understanding about how designers and other practitioners use Speculative Design techniques in order to compose future scenarios. On top of that, we have reflected on how these techniques can be introduced in education processes and paths to trigger ethical, critical, innovative designs which are able to bring together different publics in participatory ways.

To do this, we have used a series of different sources of information.

First of all, we used the interviews to speculative design practitioners that were performed during the project, in which we investigated how different subjects and organizations approach speculative design and related practices, how they integrate them in their work, what scenarios they envision for speculative design, and how they imagine it being integrated in education practices.

On top of that, we performed an extensive research about the tools, materials, models and process architectures that different practitioners use in their practice, as well as in workshop, courses, corporate sessions, and more.

As part of the SpeculativeEdu project we are creating an online repository of materials, documentation, tools and references so that a series of resources can be made easily accessible to perform speculative design processes, and to be able to have these resources from coming multiple origins readily available for analysis, to better understand the wider picture of speculative design as it is intended from multiple parties and organizations.

The online repository is [HERE](https://github.com/speculativeedu/The-SpeculativeEdu-Online-Repository), and it will be mentioned multiple times in this article, to have some practical examples available.

## Analysis

From both types of inspection, it appears clear how most subjects in the domain intend speculative design as an approach, more than a formal methology, with the intent of bringing together multiple disciplines, skills, competences, cultures and interests, and to have the flexibility which is necessary, first of all, to convey the results of the technical and technological investigations into narrative form and diegetic outputs which are able to engage all senses. And, then, to be able to have the irony, curiosity and spectacularity which is necessary in order to engage different kind of people, from niches to mainstream, so that the information and knowledge coming from science and technology do not remain in the technical domain, but become an opportunity to bring communities together into a critical reflection around possible future scenarios of their cities, environment, schools, offices, homes etc.

In the following sections we will first analyse the interviews that we have collected, then compare the toolkits and methods that have been made available by design practitioners. In the end we will draw some conclusions about the most salient characteristics of speculative design approaches and about the tools that are available, and about the ways in which speculative design can be included in education processes.

### The Interviews

The SpeculativeEdu project has collected a number of interviews from speculative design practitioners. Each interviewed subject has been asked a series of questions: some of the questions were common among all interviews, while some others were specific for each practitioner.
You can find the interviews [HERE](http://speculativeedu.eu/category/interviews/).

We have produced a number of sythetic infograsphics which allow us to inspect the principal characteristics of each approach. You can find the infographics [HERE](https://github.com/speculativeedu/The-SpeculativeEdu-Online-Repository/tree/master/Methods_and_tools/Approaches) in the online repository.

Each infographic is similar to the following one, coming from the interview with Daniel Kaplan:

![Infographic for Daniel Kaplan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speculativeedu/The-SpeculativeEdu-Online-Repository/master/Methods_and_tools/Approaches/DanielKaplan.png)

The central part of each infographic is occupied by a word cloud generated from the text of the interviews, with each represented word's size proportional to the frequency in which it is used in the interview. This allows us to get a first initial understanding of the focuses of the particular subject, and comparing these focuses permits us to start understanding how different practitioners focus on different things to achieve their goals.

For example, in the graphic above, we can see that Daniel Kaplan – apart from words that, in an interview like this, have prominence across all interview texts, like for the word "Design" – has a stong focus on people, on work and on the concept of "creating different narratives for the future".

If we look at all the word clouds, and compare the results, it is possible to describe the principal focuses of the different "families" of speculative design practitioners, or, at least, their focuses on how they express them in their interviews, aka the way in which they represent themselves in public communication.

Among the concepts which are more consistently focuses across all interviews, are:

* __Design__, as the main container of the discussion;
* __Possibility__, intended as the need to regain the "sense of possible";
* __Futures__, plural, as the process of imagining different possible futures;
* __Narrative__ and, thus, the focus on stories, and the way in which they constitute a very effective way to share knowledge, insights and visions;
* __Thinkable__, intended as the capacity to have an un-inhibited approach to imagining things;
* __Different / Alternative__, or the possibility to think scenarios that can also be radically different from the ones today;
* __Produce__ and, thus, an active, participatory approach;
* __People__, like above, in a vision of active participation and awareness;
* Speculative design as a __Practice__;
* __World__, in the sense of world-building, or describing a world through its objects, behaviours, processes...;
* __Context__, as above, meaning that the designs need to be in context, taking into account both planetary issues (climate, energy, poverty...) and local ones;
* __Critical / Ethical__, as fundamental characteristics of these practices;
* __Workshops__, as one of the most frequent forms of expression of this practice;
* __DIY (Do It Yourself)__, as a fundamental process to create speculations;
* __Design Thinking__, as a term of comparison, as if Speculative Design was in some way built on top of it;
* __Climate change__, as the most pressing issue to respond to, in all its manifestations;
* __Consequences__, in the sense that projects (and the narratives which they define) should deal with the consequences of the designs, so much that the narrations should be able to make strong statements about them;
* __Physical / Sensorial__, meaning that the projects should come under the form of something that is in the physical world, and that is able to deal with all the senses and with communication, as a very effective way to transfer pragmatic knowledge and understanding of the scenarios which are designed.

These items above appear consistently, and may be adopted as a reasonable starting foundation in defining the characteristics of speculative design approaches.

Even more insights can be drawn by diving into the interviews, and catching some important statements they contain. We can see them in the lower sections of the interviews' infographics.
